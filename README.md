A population growth simulator that uses the simple blahaj as an example
 
 warning: it is broken on firefox and will load infinitly.

 
It starts by bringing up settings. Choose the amount of time you want each shark to spend as an adult(blahaj) and child(smolhaj). also choose how many smolhajar every blahaj couple produces each turn.
 
 once you choose all the settings, hit ok and it will take you to show how the population grows or shrinks.


   and also some code snippets may have been generated by ai, as i use gemini at the top of google searches.
