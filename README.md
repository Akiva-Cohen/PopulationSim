A population growth simulator that uses the simple blahaj as an example
 
It starts by bringing up settings. Choose the amount of time you want each shark to spend as an adult(blahaj) and child(smolhaj). also choose how many smolhajar every blahaj couple produces each turn.
 
 once you choose all the settings, hit ok and it will take you to show how the population grows or shrinks.

 
 i plan on including more features in future updates so stay tuned.
  also please keep in mind it is optomized to look good run localy, so forgive the web deployment.

   and also some code snippets may have been generated by ai, as i use gemini at the top of google searches.
